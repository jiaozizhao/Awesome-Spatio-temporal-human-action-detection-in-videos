# Awesome-Spatio-temporal-human-action-detection-in-videos
Human spatio-temporal action detection is for answering when (from what time to what time), where (postions), and what actions occur in a given video. It is a crucial ability for selfdriving cars, autonomous care robots, and advanced video search engines. 

This repo is a collection of resources for spatio-temporal human action detection in videos, including datasets, evaluation metrics, and SOTA methods.
